Fillbeta – Private Form Autofill Extension
Last updated: January 2026
1. Introduction
Fillbeta (“we”, “our”, or “the extension”) is a browser extension designed to help users autofill online forms using temporary, non-personal identities to enhance privacy and reduce exposure of real personal data.
We are committed to protecting user privacy and transparency.
2. Data We Do NOT Collect
Fillbeta does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.
Specifically:
❌ No names

3. How Fillbeta Works
All identity generation happens locally in your browser
Autofill actions are initiated manually by the user
No background automation
No remote servers involved
No cloud storage
Generated data exists only temporarily in memory and is not persisted unless required by browser session behavior.
4. Email & Phone Verification Services

We do not control or access any data entered or received on those sites.
Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of third-party services before use.
